# DK Assist Community

An Unholy Death Knight quality-of-life addon for World of Warcraft Retail / Midnight.

This is a community-maintained fork of **DK Assist** by ZachoWOW. It retains the original MIT license and attribution while adding 12.1 compatibility fixes and quality-of-life improvements.

## Features

- **Festering Scythe warning** — configurable action-bar or Cooldown Manager glow when Festering Strike changes to Festering Scythe; includes expiry timing, combat-start reminder, and optional Lesser Ghoul reminder.
- **Festering Scythe WA-Style alert** — a separate movable text alert with its own timing, font, outline, size, colour presets, live preview, green/yellow/red countdown, and an optional EXPIRED state that remains until combat ends or the buff refreshes.
- **Sudden Doom glows** — separate, configurable alerts for Death Coil and Epidemic when Sudden Doom procs. Necrotic Coil and Graveyard are also supported where applicable.
- **Sudden Doom WA-Style alert** — a separate movable and fully configurable text alert for Sudden Doom procs.
- **Putrefy hold warning** — configurable red cross or glow that tells you to hold Putrefy while Dark Transformation is unavailable. The warning hides during Dark Transformation and its Death Coil / Epidemic duration extensions.
- **Runic Power cap warning** — glow your Runic Power bar at a configurable threshold to prevent overcapping; supports Blizzard and compatible UI bars.
- **Death and Decay tracker** — tracks the active Death and Decay window with optional movable display controls.
- **Soul Reaper control** — choose Blizzard's normal execute glow or suppress it entirely.
- **Four glow styles** — Pixel Glow, Autocast Shine, Button Glow, and Proc Border, with independent colours, presets, animation settings, thickness/particles, and opacity where relevant.
- **Action Bar or Cooldown Manager** — choose the target for Festering Scythe, Sudden Doom, and Putrefy warnings; includes Rescan Bars and Test tools.
- **Selectable standalone themes** — Classic plus Carbon Cyan, Graphite Red, Obsidian Lime, Frosted Blue, Slate Orange, and Unholy Green. Themes restyle the standalone window without changing Blizzard's AddOns settings page.
- **Modern settings controls** — themed dropdowns, sliders, value fields, and buttons in the standalone window, with live previews and Esc-to-close support.
- **Convenient access** — minimap button, addon compartment entry, HidingBar / DataBroker support, and the `/dka` command.
